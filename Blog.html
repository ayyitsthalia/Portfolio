<p>My idea of robots didn't really change from our discussions about robots and their ethics. 
I have always thought that robots would be a positive impact for some problems and issues for people with disabilities, mental illnesses,
and etc. Robots would also reduce the number of dangerous situations such as car accidents and more. Although some people would become lazier, 
I believe that robots would positively impact the world more than negatively.</p>

<p>I am excited for the future of robotics because it would improve the lives of so many people that feel miserable because of their condition. 
It makes me nervous about how much more we would rely on technology for easy tasks because we already rely so much on technology. 
</p>

<p> We worked on circuits in groups, it was super fun and we could rely on each other for certain things. It would have been easier if we 
had more of the object we were working on because it was difficult to do it across 2 tables. The laptops would make it difficult to work because 
they're bulky if we only had 1 desk. </p>

  <p>Manuela Veloso's work is similar with Ayanna Howard's in a way that they both want to increase knowledge about robots and use
    technology to advance communities. </p>
  
  <p>My team worked together on the lightshow by working together to reach a decision. We had to decide what we wanted to do and when 
    that didn't work out, we were okay with it. I think we make a good team because we have certain people assigned with tasks. Our 
    teamwork could have improved a little when doing our assigned tasks, I think we could have included everyone in a particular task more. </p> 
  
  <p> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are jumper wires and resistors. </p>
